# Olympic odyssey
Sports Analytics and Prediction System 

This project is divided into three parts and focuses on analyzing the performance of athletes, coaches, teams, and events, along with predicting future outcomes using machine learning algorithms. 
The goal of this project is to help users predict the performance of athletes and aid in market strategies for platforms like Dream 11, where users can place bets and earn rewards based on their predictions.

# Overview

# Part 1: Data and Visualizations
- Data Files: 
  - 5 CSV files containing information about:
    1. Athletes
    2. Coaches
    3. Events
    4. Teams
    5. Medals
  - These CSV files serve as the database for our project and store vital details for further analysis.
  
- Charts and Graphs:
  - Visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, and histograms to represent:
    - Athlete Performance: Track performance metrics of athletes over time.
    - Players by State: Count of players participating from different states.
    - Team Comparisons: Statistical comparisons of team achievements.
  - Libraries used: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` for data handling and visualization.

# Part 2: Statistical Reports and Insights
- The charts and graphs generated in Part 1 provide a comprehensive overview of:
  - Athlete Performance: Showing trends in individual performances over events.
  - State Participation: Analyzing player representation from various regions.
  - Medal Distribution: Highlighting which teams or regions win the most medals.
- This part aims to provide insights that can influence strategy, training, and team formation.

# Part 3: Machine Learning for Predicting Athlete Performance
- In this part, we will implement machine learning algorithms to predict whether an athlete will win or lose a game. These predictions can be crucial for platforms like Dream 11, where users can bet on player performance.
- The project utilizes historical data and performance metrics to make predictions using supervised learning techniques.
- Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

# Technology Stack
- Database: MySQL for storing and managing the CSV files.
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn for prediction models.
  
# Use Cases
- Dream 11 Market Strategy: The predictions generated by our machine learning models can be used to inform betting strategies and increase user engagement on platforms like Dream 11, allowing users to make educated bets on player performance.
